# programming_test
Write a program in your preferred language that given an array of integers A will find all the pairs of numbers that if subtracted will result in a specific given number M. For example for the array A={4,5,10,11,6} and the number M=-1 will return the following pairs: 0-1, 2-3, 1-4. This means that A[0]-A[1]=4-5=-1 A[2]-A[3]=10-11=-1 and A[1]-A[4]=5- 6=-1. Please explain the space/time performance and other trade-offs.
